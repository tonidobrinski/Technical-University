Moving is as follows:

First click the Yellow GPS (starting point)

Then click a tile on left/right/top/down, it depends on the position of
the starting GPS. Movement is possible only in these four directions.

Your aim is finding the house of Baba Qga which is on one of the Green Gps tiles.

Everytime you move, you must click the last yellow tile(your last position)
and then click a tile next to it in one of the four possible directions.

You CANNOT pass through a Blue one.
You CANNOT pass through yourself (Yellow one) or go backward through yourself.
You CAN pass freely through a Green one.

When you choose to move on a red one, it will visualize a question on that red tile.
When you click second time on that Red tile(already with question on it),
there is 20% chance of becoming a Blue one or 80% chance of
becoming Yellow(it means you moved successfully and that's your new position).

If there is no exit (you are *surrounded with blue ones* or *blue ones and yourself*
or *nowhere to go on right/left/up/down and along with this surrounded with blue Tiles and/or yourself*)
game will end automatically.

There is Restart button if you win.

Good luck!
